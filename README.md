# Bot-Telegram-Python-Inventaris-Tugas
<strong>2nd Final Project in API Programming</strong><br>

This project is closely related to telegram bots, which themselves have an important role in teaching and learning activities in a classroom. This bot can perform task inventory periodically. This bot is built with the help of a platform called ``` pythonanywhere ```. In this project, the program creator uses ``` python version 3.6 ``` because it is known to have advantages in syntax. The purpose of this project is to help lecturers or teachers in taking inventory of their students' assignments and anticipate errors that might occur, namely forgetting to recap, this is due to the busy messaging activities in a class social media group, in this case telegram.

2. Register for a ``` pythonanywhere account ``` :<br>

   ```bash
   https://www.pythonanywhere.com/registration/register/beginner/
   ```
3. Login to ``` pythonanywhere account ```.
   
4. Create a new directory on the ``` pythonanywhere platform ``` by clicking on ``` Files ``` at the top -> Type in the ``` Directories ``` section: ``` Pertemuan6 ``` -> Click ``` New directory ```.

5. Then upload ``` Bot-Pertemuan6.py ``` by clicking the ``` Upload a file ``` button.

6. Make page duplication -> Go to the duplication page -> Click on ``` Open Bash console here ```.
  
7. Then type this in the console :
   ```bash
   pip3.6 install --user pytelegrambotapi
   ```

8. Return to the initial tab, then open the file ``` Bot-Pertemuan6.py ``` -> refresh the page: ``` F5 ``` -> ``` run ```.
    
9. Enjoy [Done].

## Reminder
• Pay attention to writing good and correct syntax because python is case sensitive.

• Make sure your PC/Laptop is connected to the internet.
